## Architecture Decisions

### Client-Side Cart
The shopping cart is implemented using React Context and persisted in localStorage. This approach was chosen to:
- Provide a seamless user experience without page reloads
- Eliminate the need for a backend database for unauthenticated users
- Reduce server load by handling cart operations client-side

### Pricing Structure
The application implements a custom pricing structure for products based on quantity:
- 100 pills: $100
- 200 pills: $180
- 300 pills: $240
- 500 pills: $480

This tiered pricing model encourages bulk purchases while providing clear value to customers.

### SEO Strategy
The website implements advanced SEO techniques including:
- Structured data for products using JSON-LD
- Comprehensive metadata for all pages
- Semantic HTML structure
- Optimized image loading with Next.js Image component
- Canonical URLs to prevent duplicate content issues

## Conclusion

This e-commerce platform demonstrates modern web development practices with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. The codebase is structured to be maintainable, performant, and SEO-friendly, with a focus on providing an excellent user experience across all devices.
