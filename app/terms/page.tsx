            <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">Telemedicine involves the delivery of health care services using electronic communications, information technology, or other means between a health care provider and a patient who are not in the same physical location. Telemedicine may be used for diagnosis, treatment, follow-up and/or patient education, and may include, but is not limited to:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
              <li>Electronic transmission of medical records, photo images, personal health information, or other data between a patient and health care provider;</li>
              <li>Interactions between a patient and health care provider via audio, video, and/or data communications; and</li>
              <li>Use of output data from medical devices, sound, and video files.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">The electronic systems used in the SuperPill Service will incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the privacy and security of health information and imaging data, and will include measures to safeguard the data to ensure its integrity against intentional or unintentional corruption.</p>
            <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">Please see our Consent to Telehealth and at SuperPill.com for a description of the risks and benefits of telemedicine.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mb-3 mt-6">YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SUPERPILL</h2>
            <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">SuperPill provides a platform for you to consult with a health care provider affiliated with SuperPill or similar affiliated professional entity and obtain access to additional information, which you may or may not choose to utilize in planning your health care and wellness. The health and wellness resources made available through our Service are not a substitute for direct in-person health care services. The decision to focus on diagnosis, treatment recommendations, or both rests with you and the health care provider. You understand that by coordinating and in certain cases consulting with a SuperPill or affiliate health care provider through the Service, you are not entering into a provider-patient relationship with SuperPill.</p>
            <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">By accepting the Terms of Use, you understand that a health care provider may send you messages, reports, and emails via the Service regarding the treatment of your condition or in response to your inquiry. It is your responsibility to monitor these messages, reports, and emails. You agree that you will not hold us liable for any loss, injury, or claims of any kind resulting from your failure to read these messages or for your failure to comply with any treatment recommendations contained in these messages.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mb-3 mt-6">CONSULTATIVE SERVICE</h2>
            <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">In some cases, a health care provider may use the Service to provide advice or treatment to you. A health care provider consulting with you through the Service may not have the benefit of information that would be obtained by examining you in person and observing your physical condition, in each instance. Therefore, the health care provider may not be aware of facts or information that would affect his or her opinion of your diagnosis. To reduce the risk to you of this limitation, SuperPill strongly encourages you to provide all relevant information and discuss all diagnosis and treatment options with a health care provider. Moreover, a health care provider utilizing SuperPill may be limited by state law in prescribing certain medications to you without first conducting an in-person physical examination. By deciding to engage the Services, you acknowledge and agree that you are aware of these limitations and agree to assume the risk of these limitations. Furthermore, you agree and accept that: (i) the diagnosis you will receive is limited and, in some cases, provisional; (ii) the health care services are not intended, in all cases, to replace a full medical evaluation or an in-person visit with a health care provider; (iii) a health care provider acting through the Service may not have important information that is usually obtained through a “hands-on” physical examination; and (iv) the absence of a physical examination may affect the health care provider’s ability to diagnose your condition, disease or injury.</p>

You should check product information (including package inserts) regarding dosages, precautions, warnings, interactions and contraindications before administering or using any medications. If you have any questions regarding your prescriptions, you should consult your healthcare professional or pharmacist, whose contact information may be listed on the prescription, the packaging of your prescription medicine or under your account.</p>

You are responsible for changing your password promptly if you think it has been compromised. You may not transfer or share your password with anyone, or create more than one account. Creating more than one account substantially limits our ability to provide proper services. SuperPill explicitly disclaims liability for any and all losses and damages arising from your failure to comply with this section. You may not use anyone else’s account at any time.</p>

Any dispute arising under or relating in any way to these Terms of Use will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration in Los Angeles, California, under the rules of the American Arbitration Association, except that either party may bring a claim related to intellectual property rights, or seek temporary and preliminary specific performance and injunctive relief, in any court of competent jurisdiction, without the posting of bond or other security.
